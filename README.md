# Neural Networks for Health Technology Application
In this branch, I explored the world of Neural Network during my student exchange period in Finland. I studied three different case studies in an attempt to implement different types of neural networks and data processing techniques. This includes: 

1. Case 1: Binary Classifcation (Simple Neural Network)
2. Case 2: Image Processing (Convulational Neural Network)
3. Case 3: NLP (An amalgamation of different models)

In some cases, multiple models were used in order to find the most suitable one for the respective case study. The notebooks uploaded in this branch were my findings.
