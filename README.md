This branch contains the documentation for my very first attempt at making a mobile application. Unfortunately, the source code is too big to be uploaded here, so you can check it out by clicking on this link:

This application sought to automate the leave system at a nearby primary school. Admittedly, the coding is a bit messy, there is definitely room for improvement, but as a first attempt, I think it's okay. We used Android Studio as the IDE. We used Java as the primary programming language. We also used HostStinger to host our application online.
